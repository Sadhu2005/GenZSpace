# 🧪 Test Clean CI/CD Setup

## ✅ **Current Clean Setup**

You now have **only 2 workflows**:
- `app-deploy.yml` - App deployment only
- `website-deploy.yml` - Website deployment only

## 🧪 **Test Commands**

### **Test 1: Website Deployment Only**
```bash
# Make a small change to website
echo "<!-- Website test $(date) -->" >> website/index.html
git add website/
git commit -m "Test website deployment only"
git push
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Only `website-deploy.yml` should run
- ✅ No app workflows should run
- ✅ Website should deploy to Hostinger

### **Test 2: App Deployment Only**
```bash
# Make a small change to app
echo "// App test $(date)" >> lib/main.dart
git add lib/
git commit -m "Test app deployment only"
git push
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Only `app-deploy.yml` should run
- ✅ No website workflows should run
- ✅ App should build and deploy

## 🔍 **What to Check**

### **In GitHub Actions:**
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Look for **only 1 workflow** running per test
3. Check the workflow name matches what you expect

### **For Website Test:**
- Should see: **"🌐 Deploy Website to Hostinger"**
- Should NOT see: **"📱 Deploy App to Firebase & Play Store"**

### **For App Test:**
- Should see: **"📱 Deploy App to Firebase & Play Store"**
- Should NOT see: **"🌐 Deploy Website to Hostinger"**

## 🚨 **If You Still See Multiple Workflows**

### **Possible Causes:**
1. **Old workflow runs** still showing in GitHub (these are historical)
2. **Cached workflows** in GitHub
3. **Multiple commits** triggering different workflows

### **Solutions:**
1. **Wait for current runs to complete**
2. **Check if you're pushing to the right branch** (main/master)
3. **Verify you're only changing the right files**

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

### **Website Changes:**
- Edit `website/index.html` → Only website workflow runs
- Edit `website/privacy.html` → Only website workflow runs
- Edit `website/assets/css/style.css` → Only website workflow runs

### **App Changes:**
- Edit `lib/main.dart` → Only app workflow runs
- Edit `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` → Only app workflow runs
- Edit `android/app/build.gradle.kts` → Only app workflow runs

### **Both Changes:**
- Edit both `website/` and `lib/` → Both workflows run (this is expected)

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

### **Website Deployment Success:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions shows green checkmark
- ✅ Website loads at https://genzspace.in
- ✅ Privacy policy accessible
- ✅ No app workflows run

### **App Deployment Success:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions shows green checkmark
- ✅ Firebase shows new build
- ✅ Google Play Console shows new version
- ✅ No website workflows run

## 🚀 **Ready to Test**

Your CI/CD is now clean and should work correctly:

1. **Test website deployment** with a small change
2. **Verify only website workflow runs**
3. **Test app deployment** with a small change
4. **Verify only app workflow runs**

**The old workflow runs you see are historical - they won't affect new deployments!** 🎉
