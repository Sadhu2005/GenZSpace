# 🌐 Website-Only CI/CD Test

## ✅ **Current Setup**

**Active Workflows:**
- ✅ `website-deploy.yml` - **ACTIVE** (Website deployment only)
- ❌ `app-deploy.yml.disabled` - **DISABLED** (App deployment temporarily disabled)

## 🧪 **Test Website Deployment Only**

### **Step 1: Make a Test Change**
```bash
# Add a test comment to website
echo "<!-- Website test $(date) -->" >> website/index.html
```

### **Step 2: Commit and Push**
```bash
git add website/
git commit -m "Test website deployment only"
git push
```

### **Step 3: Check GitHub Actions**
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Look for **"🌐 Deploy Website to Hostinger"**
3. **Should NOT see** any app-related workflows

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **What Should Happen:**
- ✅ **Only 1 workflow** should run: "🌐 Deploy Website to Hostinger"
- ✅ **No app workflows** should run
- ✅ **Website should deploy** to Hostinger
- ✅ **Live website** should update at https://genzspace.in

### **What Should NOT Happen:**
- ❌ **No app workflows** should run
- ❌ **No Firebase deployment** should happen
- ❌ **No Google Play Store** upload should happen

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

### **1. Check GitHub Actions:**
- Go to **Actions** tab
- Look for **only** "🌐 Deploy Website to Hostinger"
- Verify it shows **green checkmark** when complete

### **2. Check Live Website:**
- Visit https://genzspace.in
- Look for your test comment in the HTML source
- Verify the website loads correctly

### **3. Check Privacy Policy:**
- Visit https://genzspace.in/privacy.html
- Verify it loads correctly

## 🚨 **If You Still See Multiple Workflows**

### **Possible Causes:**
1. **Old workflow runs** still showing (these are historical)
2. **Cached workflows** in GitHub
3. **Multiple commits** in the same push

### **Solutions:**
1. **Wait for current runs to complete**
2. **Check if you're pushing to the right branch** (main/master)
3. **Verify you're only changing website files**

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

### **Website Deployment Success:**
- ✅ GitHub Actions shows green checkmark
- ✅ Website loads at https://genzspace.in
- ✅ Privacy policy accessible
- ✅ **Only 1 workflow** ran (website deployment)

## 🚀 **Ready to Test**

Your setup is now **website-only**:

1. **Make a small change** to any file in `website/` folder
2. **Commit and push** to GitHub
3. **Check Actions tab** - should see only website workflow
4. **Verify live website** updates

**Once website deployment works perfectly, we'll re-enable app CI/CD!** 🎯
