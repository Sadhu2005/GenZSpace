echo ðŸ“± Step 5: Verify Phone Updates Work
echo ====================================
echo.
echo 1. Check your phone settings:
echo    - Go to Settings â†’ Apps â†’ Google Play Store
echo    - Make sure "Auto-update apps" is enabled
echo    - Or set to "Auto-update apps over Wi-Fi only"
echo.
echo 2. Test the complete flow:
echo    a) Make a change in your code (add a comment or change text)
echo    b) Commit and push:
echo       git add .
echo       git commit -m "Test automatic update - version 1.0.2"
echo       git push origin main
echo    c) Wait 5-10 minutes for CI/CD to complete
echo    d) Check your phone for update notification
echo.
echo 3. Expected behavior:
echo    âœ… GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically
echo    âœ… App builds and uploads to Play Store
echo    âœ… Play Store notifies you of update
echo    âœ… You tap "Update" to get latest version
echo    âœ… App updates without losing data
echo.
echo 4. Troubleshooting:
echo    - If no update appears, check Play Console
echo    - Go to "Testing" â†’ "Internal testing" â†’ "Releases"
echo    - Make sure the release is "Rolled out to testers"
echo    - Check that you're added as a tester
echo.
echo 5. Success indicators:
echo    âœ… You can push code changes
echo    âœ… GitHub Actions runs automatically
echo    âœ… Your phone gets update notifications
echo    âœ… App updates without manual installation
echo    âœ… You can test new features immediately
