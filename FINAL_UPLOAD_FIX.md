# üîß Final Upload Action Fix Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:**

The `r0adkll/upload-google-play@v1.0.3` action has a **known bug** where:
- The JSON private key content gets parsed as file paths
- Causes `ENAMETOOLONG` errors  
- Prevents successful uploads

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION OPTIONS:**

### **Option 1: Use Alternative Action**
```yaml
- name: Upload to Google Play
  uses: rlespinasse/action-upload-to-google-play@v1
  with:
    serviceAccount: ${{ secrets.GOOGLE_PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON }}
    packageName: com.anu.GenZSpace
    aab: android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
    track: internal
```

### **Option 2: Use File-Only Approach**
Create a file and pass path reference rather than raw JSON.

### **Option 3: Manual API Implementation**
Use direct Google Play API calls with curl.

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED**
Replace the problematic action with an alternative implementation.
